# Taskbook opened (taskbook closed...)

## Description
_Taskbook opened_ (_tbo_) aims to be a simple CLI application (inspired by [taskbook](https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook) to organize tasks and notes. The progress of tasks is guided by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), so that the user can select the tasks to be done during each round. Notifications and a custom [Waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) module help the user keep an eye on the ongoing tasks and pomodoro timer.
